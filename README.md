I'm almost done with the page! Made it mobile responsive and tried to tackle the contact page (**really had to scratch my head around how flexbox worked, when to apply it to what and such**) and I hope to be done with the page by tomorrow :)

EDIT: Started on a new project! https://github.com/RobinHawiz/google-spinoff.git

Started to recreate an already existing website (from a course that I'm following) and pushing it to github! **There's a big difference in just following the course and actually trying to implement those things by myself so it's important to build your own things right after you learn something!**
